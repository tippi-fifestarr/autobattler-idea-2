## Core Concept

An async autobattler where users create and deploy code-based characters that battle automatically against other players' creations while they're offline.

### Key Requirements

- Simple Character Creation
    - Text-based interface where players describe their character's character, appearance and strategy in natural language
    - AI translates descriptions into functional battle logic and stats
    - No coding knowledge required from players
- Battle Mechanics
    - Turn-based combat with predetermined actions based on character strategy
    - Characters have basic stats: Health, Attack, Defense, Speed
    - Special abilities triggered by simple conditions (e.g., "when below 30% health")
- Async Gameplay
    - Players set up their character once, then battles occur automatically
    - Results and replays viewable when player returns
    - Daily leaderboard updates

### Implementation Plan (30-Minute Deploy)

- Frontend: Simple web interface using Replit + HTML/CSS/JS
- Backend: Firebase for user accounts and battle results storage
- Battle Logic: OpenAI API to translate character descriptions into battle actions
- Deployment: Vercel or Netlify for instant hosting

### Engagement Hooks

- Daily challenges with special rules
- Character evolution based on battle performance
- Community voting on most creative character concepts

The game emphasizes creativity over complexity, allowing anyone to participate regardless of technical skill while still providing depth through emergent strategy.
